# Project Reflections

## My Thoughts

The myFlix React App is a single-page, responsive movie application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It serves as the client-side for a movie database, allowing users to browse movies, view detailed information, search through titles, and manage a personalized list of favorites. The app connects to a pre-existing REST API, ensuring users always have access to the latest movie data.

My Role and Tasks Completed

Role: Full-Stack Developer (client-side focus)

Tasks:
Designed and implemented the user interface using React and Bootstrap.
Set up client-side routing with React Router.
Integrated REST API endpoints for movie and user data.
Developed views for movie browsing, detailed movie information, user login, registration, and profile management.
Ensured the app was fully responsive and provided a polished user experience.
Decisions, Consequences, and Reflections

Decisions:

React for the UI: Chose React due to its component-based architecture which allowed for reusable code and rapid development.

React Router for Navigation: Implemented routing to provide a seamless, single-page experience.

Outcomes:

Positive: Improved maintainability and scalability; smooth and dynamic user interface.

Challenges: Managing state and API calls required careful planning and debugging.

What I Would Do Differently:
Enhance error handling and validation for API requests.
Increase test coverage by adding unit and integration tests.
Explore more advanced state management solutions, such as React Redux, for even smoother data flow.

Lessons Learned:
The importance of planning and structuring a codebase for readability and scalability.
How to efficiently integrate multiple technologies (React, REST APIs, Bootstrap) to create a seamless user experience.
The value of iterative development and regular reflection to continuously improve the project.
